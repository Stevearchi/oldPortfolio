          Known as a jack of all trades when it comes to Web Development. Agile development skills which were
          learned during my eight years as a SQE were recently applied to develop a workout/calorie counter mobile app.
          We leveraged React Native, Expo, MongoDB and other technologies while writing this application. 
          Excited to leverage skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team in order to build better 
          experiences on the web.
